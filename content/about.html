However, there’s more to my story than you’ll find on LinkedIn or online resume listings. Over the past few years I have returned to my original passion – big data, artificial intelligence and related areas in data science. I built this site to showcase anonymized and abstracted examples of that work along with personal/side projects in mobile and IoT. As these projects mature I’ll extend this portfolio and add entries with code excerpts and other details about each project.</p>
