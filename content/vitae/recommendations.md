                        <p class="card-text">Houston is a nurturing and supportive technical leader. The interview process with him was as much about aptitude and experience as specific technical skills. He has a talent of making people comfortable in the toughest situations. After I started, he was generous with his time, helping me to become comfortable with the demands of the job. He also valued my experience - asking my advice unique to my background with other companies. Houston is a high-level manager who embraces the details and motivates people to achieve more. Conversations with Houston always amazes me with the in-depth knowledge he has in almost EVERY topic in the world. I highly recommend working with and for him.</p>

His domain experience with applied data science shortens time to insight both in analysis and operational phases of the process. I highly recommend him.</p>
