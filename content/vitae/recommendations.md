                        <p class="card-text">Houston is a nurturing and supportive technical leader. The interview process with him was as much about aptitude and experience as specific technical skills. He has a talent of making people comfortable in the toughest situations. After I started, he was generous with his time, helping me to become comfortable with the demands of the job. He also valued my experience - asking my advice unique to my background with other companies. Houston is a high-level manager who embraces the details and motivates people to achieve more. Conversations with Houston always amazes me with the in-depth knowledge he has in almost EVERY topic in the world. I highly recommend working with and for him.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The events that have taken place over the last six months, coupled with the pandemic have re-shaped the ethos.  As a founder of an entertainment tech company, I have been faced with the most challenging times.  Not only did we have to shift our business roadmap, reallocate funds but we also lost most of our dev team.  With limited resources and time I had to find the right engineer to step in and help us recover.  Houston was able to immediately assist and guide us through the most pressing times.  He was successful in re-defining our product roadmap and provided counsel for technical and business domains in equal measure. His insight into front-of-house and back office operational systems along with his analytics expertise helped us to season our approach as we worked closely with global media companies. I can recommend him both for his amazing engineering capability, unparalleled problem solving skills  and his ability to earn the trust of our global multi cultural business partners.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Houston applies an academic understanding of machine learning to real-world problems with a balance of rigor and pragmatism. His domain experience with applied data science shortens time to insight both in analysis and operational phases of the process. I highly recommend him.</p>
