                        Houston applies an academic understanding of machine learning to real-world problems with a balance of rigor and pragmatism. His domain experience with applied data science shortens time to insight both in analysis and operational phases of the process. I highly recommend him.

                        Houston is a nurturing and supportive technical leader. The interview process with him was as much about aptitude and experience as specific technical skills. He has a talent of making people comfortable in the toughest situations. After I started, he was generous with his time, helping me to become comfortable with the demands of the job. He also valued my experience - asking my advice unique to my background with other companies. Houston is a high-level manager who embraces the details and motivates people to achieve more. Conversations with Houston always amazes me with the in-depth knowledge he has in almost EVERY topic in the world. I highly recommend working with and for him.

                    <div class="card-body w-75">The events that have taken place over recent months have re-shaped  the ethos. As a founder of an entertainment tech company, I was faced with responding to the most challenging market conditions of the modern era. With limited resources and time I had to find the right technical leader to step in to re-orient our business. Houston immediately helped us navigate through the most pressing times. He was successful in re-defining our product road map and provided counsel for technical and business domains in equal measure. His insight into front-of-house and back office systems along with his analytics expertise helped us to season our approach as we forged new partnerships with media companies. I can recommend him for his amazing engineering capability, unparalleled problem solving skills and his ability to earn the trust of our global, multi-cultural business partners.</div>
