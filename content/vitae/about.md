# Hello and Welcome!
{{< rawhtml >}}
<div class="clearfix"><img class="ui small float-left rounded bordered image mr-3" src="/img/H3_suit.jpg">Since you were likely referred one of my public profiles, you might have an idea of my skills and background. However, there’s more to my story than you’ll find on LinkedIn or online resume listings. Over the past few years I have returned to my original passion – big data, artificial intelligence and related areas in data science. I built this site to showcase anonymized and abstracted examples of that work along with personal/side projects in mobile and IoT. As these projects mature I’ll extend this portfolio and add entries with code excerpts and other details about each project.
