<h1>Not always the good kind</h1>

<p>I was fortunate to be part of several successful start-up "exits" early in my career, before the dot com crash in the late 90s. Those positions don't show up in my LinkedIn profile or on my resume because I found that showing that early history is often met with forms of age discrimination. I'm in the LA tech market after all, so it's practically expected. Either way this isn't about *that* kind of exit. This is about my recent consulting history, where some stints are quite short. In many cases they were contract-to-hire opportunities, but in other cases they were fixed statements of work. And of course some were just a bad culture fit. Each entry below delves a bit into the context of the role and the reasons why - where applicable - a hire conversion didn't make sense. Whether it's technology, management or culture <strong>it all comes back to <i>lessons learned.</i></strong></p>
<br>
<h1>Embracing Advancing Technologies and Professional Goals</h1>

<p>After moving to Southern California my roles started in large organizations, as can ben seen in my LinkedIn profile. And that had all the vestiges of the long-lamented pattern of senior management's irrational tethers to antiquated work and systems. That experience caused me to rethink whether that was the correct career track. There were also <a href="/vitae/darksideofbigdata/">ethical issues</a> within certain organizations which spurred a form of professional reckoning. While considering my options, I went back to the early formative experiences <a href="/vitae/mlbyaccident/">with Moog</a> and <a href="/vitae/earlydatascience/">at TherapyEdge</a>. I've since returned to two of the most cherished elements of that phase of my career - taking on the big problem and doing work of consequence. From 2012 onward I made the conscious decision to look for two things in a role: 1) to solve challenges with modern technology and 2) to be able to build diverse, high-performing teams. All of the jobs listed below started with some form of promise to fulfill those two goals. But as I found, with consulting for "old guard" companies those legacy instituational issues are as prominent as anywhere else. They may mouth the words "digital transformation" but rarely demonstrate the incentive to follow through. The listing below gives a highlight to companies, problems spaces encountered, and the outcome in each case.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Like many incubation projects in my early career I had hopes this would grow into an opportunity to build an organization and launch a truly groundbreaking platform. The role brought together my experience with building globally-scaled distributed systems and my extensive background in media and audio. The downside? Although it was a start-up, <strong>there already was a <i>considerable</i> amount of technical debt from previous software vendors</strong>. Then there was the Herculean task of pivoting from in-theater delivery to streaming online. </p>
                    <p>While the shift was successful by many measures, the COVID-19 pandemic along with some business decisions that pre-dated my arrival limited the options for continuing. I wish the best for SoundFi and am grateful that Chris Anastas has provided <a href="/vitae/recommendations/#SoundFi">a strong recommendation</a> for my work there.</p>

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p class="card-text">I was recruited for this role in order to anchor an office for Insight's "Digital Innovation" division in Los Angeles. The cornerstone project was a multi-year predictive deployment project with the Los Angeles County Fire Department. One phase of the project was to provide rapid recommendations for forward crew deployment. The other leg of the project was to do deep historical analysis to help determine where new permanent stations should be built within the county. So the project had both short and long-term agendas - interesting, strategic stuff.</p>
                        <p>It had all of the hallmarks of what I was looking for - to build a diverse, high-performing team on a project of real community benefit. What actually transpired was significantly different. <i>After</i> I joined Insight I learned that the <strong>LAFD had <i>not</i> officially approved the project</strong> and I got shuffled off to work on a data warehousing project for a multi-national paper company based in St. Louis. Dealing with those international politics is an essay for another time. But it allowed me to see how Insight managed client companies. Unfortunately it ws laden with perverse incentives and toxic consulting behavior equal to any project I had seen - from either the "buy" or "sell" side. </p>
                        <p>I expressed my misgivings to Insight management - both about the St. Louis assignment, the status of the LAFD contract and how Insight ran projects in general. The senior director for the department traveled to LA to meet with LAFD and afterward had a sit-down meeting with me. Basically it boiled down to "this is how consulting works", albeit over a long meal with expensive drinks and fine food. I handed in my resignation at the end of that week.</p>
                        <p>As of this writing - more than a year later - the LAFD Databricks project <i>still</i> hasn't begun.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">This was a contract-to-hire position that had many of the hallmarks of my time with TherapyEdge - opportunity to make a difference by bringing new technology to the practice of medicine. Kaiser Permanente was in the midst of a $300 million overhaul of their IT infrastructure to modernize systems and processes. While this role worked with <i>non</i>-clinical data, the importance of what they were studying - hospital utilization - had wide-ranging implications for delivery of care for millions of people. </p>
                        <p>What I <i>didn't</i> know at the time was that I was hired into a "shadow IT" group that was trying to push their part of the project forward despite a middling effort by KP's core IT services. This is never a recipe for success. I later joined a master data working group with the Chief Data Office - only to find out that there were <strong>regional and IT executives that were arguing <u>against</u> <i>the very existence</i> of a Chief Data Officer</strong>. As usual, this situation is like so many others in my 20+ year history, the IT problem was really just a symptom of a larger institutional problem.</p>
                        <p>Shortly afterward our working group's executive sponsor from the CTO departed KP, and I knew I wouldn't be far behind. I was offered full-time positions within several divisions but didn't feel like any of those situations would be a good fit. During my time there I was able to hire in many contributors that are still at the company, and I made many long-term friendships there. Several of the people I hired into KP have provided <a href="/vitae/recommendations/#KP">recommendations both here</a> and on LinkedIn, and I'm optimistic that with their skills and temperament they'll continue to excel there.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">This role provided a chance to do a deep dive into Azure's machine learning infrastructure. Attunix had been recently awarded "Partner of the Year" by Microsoft and the company was looking to expand their advanced analytics practice in the Southwest US. I was finishing up the capstone project as a Microsoft Certified Professional in their data science track and it seemed like a good fit. </p>
                        <p>I was initially assigned to a government project and was <strong>a contributor to Microsoft's Data Platform Advisory Group.</strong> I was doing some "dog food" projects in Azure in conjunction with their engineering teams. This included working with R.NET in Azure Function Apps, and I was seeing a lot of potential there over HDI and other "under the hood" technologies on offer. Beyond that I was also presenting at Ignite conferences on behalf of Microsoft - and life, as they say, was good.</p>
                        <p>Attunix was then acquired by Redapt, a company known up to that point for building private and public cloud infrastructure for other companies. With changes in the org at the office, and some of my Microsoft connections growing, they assigned me through Microsoft Consulting Services to a large project for T-Mobile. They were preparing for the Sprint merger that team was tasked with processing data from seventeen different phone networks to standardize their customer service data. </p>
                        <p>While that was going well on a technical level, the organization at T-Mobile was like any other big conglomerate where I had worked - too many competing factions that were interfering with the actual heads-down work. This created a perverse incentive and the consulting groups were happy to capitalize. I had my fill of it after six months of wading through the low-grade toxicity that the environment only seemed to amplify with the impending Sprint merger. When the SOW ended with T-Mobile I resigned from Redapt.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">This was a contract-to-hire position with a marketing conglomerate, and I knew full well that there were risks going in. They had the classic problem of ingesting huge daily volumes of data from Nielsen and other providers. The largest system there was wedging feeds into a data warehouse riddled with 5th normal form data structures and it was buckling under the weight of the vertical scale. In the interview process I advocated for a semi-structured approach, providing Hadoop cluster and data lake implementation options. The VP of the group was very enthusiastic - but oddly the interviewers from that working group were actively resistent to the idea. </p>
                        <p>I learned soon that <strong>ASM was the product of several mergers where the technology orgs from those disparate companies <i>had never been integrated</i> into a unified approach</strong>. That meant each silo had been passively conditioned to undermine the other, and only collaborated when it came time to oust a fresh voice from outside their carefully curated boundaries. This time it was me. I was sidelined to an internal project - ironically - to look at seasonal and temporary employee turnover. Through analysis of the data - and interviewing field managers about their practice - it was found that it wasn't the quality of the applicant, but rather they way they were assigned work that determined how long they remained. </p>
                        </p>I presented the findings on the story the data was telling and analysis of the field interviews - also backed by the data. The final artifact was a remediation plan for limiting the managers "gaming the system", and suggested additional points of data to be collected in order to better track behaviors and outcomes. </p>
                        </p>For that I was fired.

                        <p class="card-text">This was a contract assignment with an SOW that has a firm end date. I was selected to manage a group of KPMG contractors due to my financial management background and knowledge of Hyperion. My cloud experience also caught their attention, as they were looking for ways to streamline much of their reporting through PowerBI, and I had spent some time with Azure while at Universal Music Group. This role with Mattel had both process compliance and data management facets to the role, so it had a balance of the tried-and-true with a bit of the new-and-shiny.</p>
                        </p>
                        <p><i>The interesting part of this story comes from <strong>the backstory.</strong></i> The CEO and CFO had been removed by the board because of accounting issues that caused a potential acquisition/merger with Hasbro to be nixed. To add insult to injury, their servers housing the ledger data were so out of date that Microsoft refused to continue supporting them with security patches. Mattel was literally the very last Windows Server 2000 customer on planet Earth. This is all known in public disclosures following the changes on the executive level, so I'm not revealing any "inside baseball" here. The project I was on was a full re-architecture of their internal ledger system.</p>
                        <p>I wrote <a href="/post/hyperion-global-consolidaton/">an anonymized treatment</a> of a portion of the problem space, focusing on aleviating consolidation bottlenecks with ledger data submitted from an array of global manufacturing locations. It's a time capsule both from the perspective of early cloud adoption by large companies and in how to orchestrate a global financial reconciliation process. They kept many manual processes, again, as an institutional reflex - but the team eventually delivered a relatively modern, GAAP compliant system.</p>

                <div class="card-horizontal">
                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p class="card-text">I was really hopeful for this project, as it combined my experience with mobile application development, IoT and cloud-based systems. Honda had a telematics system that was purpose-built for limited scale of data traffic - designed for their electric and hybrid vehicles along with the full Acura line. I learned a tremendous amount about electric vehicles, and the experience reminded me of my time working for Bob Moog - but on a much bigger, more industrial scale. I spent as much time in the R&D "bench area" as in the office, so I was at home there. </p>
                        <p>The problem space included two general factors: 1) the current infrastructure was buckling under the current load, and 2) Honda was about to put <strong>all vehicle lines on their telematics backplane</strong>. The first part of the exercise was to calculate what the "data traffic" would be over the 3G backbone, and estimate the data payload and volume for the lines that would roll onto the system in future model years.</p>
                        <p>After building a simulator that showed how the system would not hold under current bandwidth constraints, I then made a recommendation for a cloud-based queueing system which would also land data in a NoSQL store. One of the dirty little secrets of the on-prem solution was that the structured data store was being truncated by the IT team. This was data that needed to be kept for 7 years to comply with NTSB regulations, and the data store preserved less than a year's worth of records. I later learned that the executives over the group rejected the idea of expanding the hard drive space because the system vendor was going to charge Honda $5000 to swap out a hard drive in the data center. In the context of a potential adverse event investigation that is a pittance - but they chose not to see the situation that way.</p>
                        <p>By request I outlined a new platform that put the entire stack in AWS, using a cascade of services to handle queueing during high-usage periods, and would have enough storage capacity to both satisfy NTSB mandates and provide reporting both for compliance purposes and for showing performance of various vehicle lines. I was fired a week later.
                        </p>
                        <p>Afterward I learned that the executive in charge of the group was a former contractor that previously ran the IT team currently truncating the data stores. There were similar "sweetheart" connections to the company managing the "private cloud" contract. A year or so later the entire working group was disbanded and a different vendor was selected to build a new solution. </p>
                        <p>Their recommendation? <i>A NoSQL solution built in AWS.</i></p>
                        <p>I have since created my own NoSQL telematics proof-of-concept in Azure, and have a blog entry here that's still in the editing phase. That article will be published soon.</p>
