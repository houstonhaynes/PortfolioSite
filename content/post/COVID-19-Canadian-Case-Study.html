<h1>History Repeats</h1>
<p>Having taken a turn with the data following Israel’s increase in mask-wearing compliance, I decided to look at the data in Canada after someone warned me about their Thanksgiving showing an ominous trend. Again, here I’m using <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/" target="_blank">Our World In Data</a> as a source.</p>
<p>I decided to map cases and deaths per million on separate axes in order to see them scaled separately. And it’s just as scary as I thought. That lagging indicator is frightening on two levels:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It’s hard to <em>not</em> see those April numbers as terrifying, and</li>
<li>Thinking of how <em>badly</em> things will go in the US in December.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many rural medical systems that are already on the brink in the US. To have a massive surge of cases after Thanksgiving would be a disaster. I hope people see this and realize they need to stay put and hunker down.</p>

The pandemic-related posts on this site are about more than data. <strong>Behind every number is a person, a family and a community.</strong> As reports are refreshed, new selections will also be chosen at random. To see how this is done, <a href="/post/faces-of-covid">see this sidebar</a>.
