<p>I have written several sidebars on portions of this blog, and this rounds out the larger picture. These breadcrumbs are to help others who may choose a similar technology path, but to be honest it’s also for my future self. In this post you’ll find links to tools and tech I used to build and improve the site. And of course there are cross-site links to some of the relevant sidebars with more detailed explanation on components I’ve built/modded along the way.</p>

<h1>Beginning with the End in Mind</h1>
The most recent addition to this site [see below] was <em>not</em> built in R or blogdown, but with Hugo. That’s part of the challenge and charm of this approach - using the right tool for the job also means being a bit of a polyglot. It has also been an object lesson I (unintentionally) re-learned while fleshing out this site: there’s a difference between being “full stack” in an enterprise setting versus public-facing software. While R has a reputation for being born out of academia, a considerable amount of community effort has been put into scaffolding web page rendering out of blogdown.
