<h1>TL;DR</h1>
<p>Adaptive Design for Software [AD4S] is born out of my successes and failures through 20+ years of building software and managing teams from start-ups to multi-national conglomerates. AD4S is a rubric for evaluating decisions within complex software while maintaining a create-then-evaluate posture. It provides descriptive and prescriptive guidance for teams to evaluate for and avoid costly mistakes in user experience, performance, scale, security as well as mitigate legal and regulatory risks. It also provides a declarative framework for anticipating potential unintended harms and related ethical considerations - particularly those ripple effects that constantly surface in “move fast and break things” culture.</p>
<p>The intent of AD4S is to form a good faith covenant between the various constituencies that build, maintain and use the software. Think of it as version management for higher-order product design. Through curation of an AD4S ledger, a constructively shared agreement is established between business leaders, customers as well as other affected groups along with the engineering teams that support the systems they build and maintain.</p>
<p>AD4S aspires to make measurable the true cost and actual consequences of product design decisions. In order to make it useful to as many organizations as possible it is conceived as a community-led project, which will pose many challenges and opportunities. For that purpose a handful of useful TLDs have been reserved. [adaptivedesign.software, ad4s.org, ad4s.net, etc.] The next step is to establish the proper location for contributions to be collected and receive comments from the broader community. The result will be a clearinghouse of information where concepts and course-corrections can be mapped out. The hope and expectation is that organizations and individual contributors of good faith will help cultivate AD4S precepts and help build an actionable, responsive and responsibility-minded compendium for crafting better software.</p>
